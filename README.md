# Pacemaker-Program
Collaborating in a team of 6, we designed a functioning pacemaker with use of a board, MATLAB, Simulink, and including working GUI framework. Project completed through McMaster University and the SFWRENG 3K04 - Software Development course. By Marcus, Vineet, Nathan, Aidan, Yajat, Mitch.

There are two major parts to this assignment. The first part involves creating real-time software on the hardware platform.
The second part involves properly documenting the development that occurs during the time of the assignment. The main
objective of this assignment is for students to be able to parse documentation provided to distill the specific information
necessary to build a functional pacemaker and DCM. We expect the students to properly identify the requirements for
this project (what they need to do for the pacemaker and DCM) and build a design that satisfies their requirements. They
will need to implement their design faithfully (simulink for the pacemaker, whatever language they want for the DCM)
and write appropriate documentation for their efforts.
